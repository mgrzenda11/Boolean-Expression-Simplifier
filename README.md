# Boolean-Expression-Simplifier
A program that simplifies boolean expressions containing the "and", "or", or "not" connectives. Expressions are created as unevaluated lists. For example: (def p1 '(and x (or x (and y (not z))))). A call to the main method "evalexp" will simplify, bind and evaluate these expressions.
